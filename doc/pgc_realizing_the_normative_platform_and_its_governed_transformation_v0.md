## Abstract

Two companion papers establish the architecture of protocol-governed computing. One defines
execution as declarative traversal of a compiled protocol; the other defines evolution as the
governed transformation of one executable baseline into the next. Both state what must be true.
Neither states what it takes to make it true, nor how one would know it had been achieved.

This paper is about realization. Protocol-Governed Computing (PGC) is realized when both the
platform and the transformation of that platform are governed, inspectable, evidence-producing
computational objects — the platform as a noun, its transformation as a verb, neither sufficient
alone.

Part I develops the **Profiled Normative Platform**: a composition of a governance surface,
conformance workloads, and optional business domains under a conformance profile, sealed into an
immutable snapshot, reachable across a governed boundary, able to answer questions about itself, and
producing evidence of what it did. A platform is a composition under a profile and never a
repository. The paper develops the consequences of that distinction and states the conditions under
which a platform may be called functioning as checkable properties rather than assertions.

Part II develops **governed transformation** and rests on a proposition the architecture could state
but not demonstrate: the current baseline is not context for a change but a *party to it* —
supplying reusable structure, bounding admissibility, and serving as the authoritative reference
against which every *empirical* claim about the predecessor is verified. Normative claims about the
successor — whether the proposed change is admissible at all — remain governed by the applicable
protocol and conformance profile. The transformation function is given formal treatment;
the conditions under which it is defined are established stage by stage; and the distinction that
makes governed evolution auditable rather than merely careful is drawn: the function is **partial** —
not every problem yields a next baseline — while the **process is total**, every failure producing a
stated finding at a named stage and never an undefined outcome. Three functions compose into a
single account of a governed system's life: transformation changes it, compilation seals it,
execution realizes it.

Part III reports what realization surfaced and architectural review did not. Constructing the platform
exposed whole capabilities that were unreachable the first time anyone used them, a class of change
the governed lifecycle could not express, and rules a domain declared that no artifact enforced.
Every one lived on a path that had never been executed, which makes defect discovery a coverage
property rather than a maturity one. Architecture establishes invariants; realization establishes
whether an implementation instantiates them. These are different epistemic activities, and treating
them as one is a plausible explanation for why architectures are so often correct while the systems
built from them are not.

A reference implementation is cited throughout as evidence and never as the subject. Each section
separates the obligation the architecture imposes from the answer this implementation gives and from
the choices incidental to it, so that the requirements remain legible when the implementation does
not.

## Preface: how to read this paper

This is the third paper in a series and the first that is not about architecture.

*Figure 1 — Lineage. The companions establish the architecture; this paper establishes what it takes
to realize it.*

The companions \[Ganti, 2026k; Ganti, 2026l\] are complete accounts of their subjects. This paper
does not restate them. Where the argument requires an architectural result, it is cited and used.
Readers who want to know *why* execution must be declarative, or *why* evolution must be
transformation rather than authoring, should read the companions; this paper assumes both and asks
what must be built.

Two earlier papers \[Ganti, 2026a; Ganti, 2026b\] developed the same substrate under the name
Protocol-Governed Systems. They remain a correct account of construction and execution and are
frozen as the historical record. Nothing here retracts them. What has changed is that a realization
layer now sits above the model they formalize, and describing that layer as a revision of them would
misdescribe both. The term used throughout this paper is **Protocol-Governed Computing (PGC)**,
which names the union of governed transformation above the protocol and declarative execution below
it. Both companions carry it, on the grounds stated in \[Ganti, 2026l, §17\]: neither half is PGC on
its own.

### The three-move device

Every realization section separates three things and says which is which.

*Figure 2 — The three-move device. What survives implementation obsolescence, and what does not.*

**The ageing test.** Delete every *Realization* and *Incidental* passage, and what remains must be a
usable specification of what it takes to build a protocol-governed platform. Appendix B extracts
exactly that. A paper about a reference implementation that cannot survive its reference
implementation has failed at its own subject.

This device is offered as a methodological contribution and not merely as a drafting convention.
Realization papers decay into manuals because they do not distinguish the obligation from the answer.
Stating the distinction structurally, and providing the extraction as an appendix, is what makes the
decay detectable.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The question this paper asks

An architecture is a claim about what must be true. A realization is a claim that something *is*
true of a particular construction. The two are related but not identical, and the gap between them
is not merely engineering labor. It is where a correct architecture meets the facts that only
construction can produce.

The companions leave that gap open by design. \[Ganti, 2026k\] establishes that a governed system
evolves by transforming an executable baseline into its successor rather than by authoring a
specification. \[Ganti, 2026l\] establishes that execution is traversal of a compiled protocol by an
interpreter that decides nothing. Both are architectural: they say what must hold. Neither says what
must be constructed, what properties distinguish a realized platform from a described one, or how
one would know the construction had succeeded.

This paper asks:

> **What does it take to realize Protocol-Governed Computing as an actual functioning computational
> platform, and how would one know it had been achieved?**

### 1.2 The thesis

> Protocol-Governed Computing is realized not merely by implementing a governed execution platform,
> but by making **both the platform and the transformation of that platform** into governed,
> inspectable, evidence-producing computational objects.

Formally, PGC is the pair:

$$\boxed{\;\text{PGC} \;=\; \{B_n\}_{n \ge 0} \;+\; \mathcal{T} \;}$$

PGC comprises a *sequence* of governed platform baselines together with the governed transformation
that relates each baseline to its successor:

$$\mathcal{T}: (B_n, P) \rightharpoonup B_{n+1}$$

The platform is the noun; transformation is the verb. Neither a single baseline nor the function
alone is the object of study: a lone baseline is a governed program, and a lone function is a
methodology. What this paper treats is the pair — a sequence of sealed states and the governed
relation between consecutive members of it.

The asymmetry between noun and verb is deliberate and is the architecture rather than a defect in the framing. A platform
is a state; a transformation is a change of state. A realization that supplies only the first is a
governed program. A realization that supplies only the second is a methodology. PGC requires both,
and requires each to be governed by the same discipline.

### 1.3 Contributions

**1. The Profiled Normative Platform (PNP)** — a definition of what a realized platform *is*: a
composition under a conformance profile rather than a repository, together with five checkable
conditions under which it may be called functioning.

**2. The baseline as a party to its own transformation** — the proposition that $B_n$ is not context
for a change but a participant in it, supplying reuse, bounding admissibility, and serving as the
reference for empirical claims about the existing system, with normative admissibility remaining
with governance. Two consequences follow: that $\mathcal{T}$ is
defined only relative to a *pinned* baseline, and that an existing implementation is part of the
specification substrate for its own successor.

**3. Determinacy conditions for governed transformation** — what must hold at each stage for
$\mathcal{T}$ to be defined, including a measure that answers whether a design determines the
artifacts it schedules rather than whether it appears complete.

**4. Partial function, total process** — the distinction that makes governed evolution auditable:
$\mathcal{T}$ is mathematically partial, while the transformation *process* is total with respect to
outcome reporting.

**5. Realization as a distinct epistemic activity** — evidence, from constructing the platform, that
architecture and realization establish different things, and that defect discovery in a governed
system is a coverage property rather than a maturity one.

# Part I — The Normative Platform

*The noun. What a realized PGC platform is, and the conditions under which it may be called
functioning.*

## 2. From architecture to obligation

**Obligation.** The companions impose requirements that read as properties: execution decides
nothing; the baseline is authoritative; behavior originates only in the protocol. A realization must
convert each into an object that exists and can be pointed at.

The distance is larger than it appears. "The runtime decides nothing" is a property. A runtime that
decides nothing is an artifact with a specific shape: it must have no branch that consults domain
meaning, no table it populates by discovery, no fallback when a declaration is absent. Each of those
is a construction decision that the property does not determine, and each can be got wrong while the
property is still recited.

The obligations this paper takes from the companions are:

1. There exists a single authoritative compiled artifact that defines the system completely, and it
   is the only thing execution reads.
2. Behavior admissible at execution is exactly the behavior present in that artifact; nothing enters
   at execution time.
3. Authority is enumerated; no execution context confers it.
4. Execution produces evidence sufficient to check the claim that it conformed.
5. The system evolves only by transforming that artifact into a successor, under governance.

Parts I and II take these in turn. This section only fixes them as obligations so that later
sections have something to discharge.

## 3. A platform is a composition, not a repository

**Obligation.** A realization must define the boundary of the thing being governed. If that boundary
is drawn at a source repository, governance becomes a property of how code is stored, which is an
accident of tooling.

**The definition.** A *Profiled Normative Platform* is:

$$PNP = \textit{Governance Surface} \;+\; \textit{Conformance Workloads} \;+\; \textit{Business Domains (optional)} \;\text{under a}\; \textit{Conformance Profile}$$

```
      ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

      │                                                      │

      │    conformance workloads     what proves conformance │
      │    business domains          what the business does  │
      │        (optional)                                    │
      │                                                      │
      │              under a conformance profile             │
      └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

              repositories, packages, directories
              are where the material is kept —
              outside the boundary, and irrelevant to it
```

*Figure 3 — The platform boundary. Composition under a profile; storage is not part of the
definition.*

Three consequences follow, and they are the reason the definition is worth stating.

**There is no single "the platform."** There are as many platforms as there are profiles. A profile
selects a governance surface and the workloads that prove conformance to it; a different profile over
the same material is a different platform, with a different admissibility set and a different
snapshot identity. Asking "is the platform conformant?" is therefore malformed until a profile is
named.

**Repository structure is an implementation detail.** The material composing a platform may be held
in one repository or twelve; the composition is unchanged. This is not a stylistic preference. When
the two boundaries are conflated, governance questions acquire spurious answers: a change is judged
"internal" because it did not cross a repository boundary, although it crossed a governance one, or
judged "external" for the opposite reason.

**The composition is the unit of release.** Because admissibility is a property of the whole, the
parts cannot be released independently and remain meaningful. A governance surface released without
the workloads that prove conformance to it has no evidence attached; a workload released against an
unnamed surface conforms to nothing in particular.

**Realization.** The reference implementation composes a governance surface, a set of conformance
workloads, and several business domains, each held in its own repository, assembled under a profile
into a single snapshot. The repositories are not the platform and are never referred to as such; the
build tooling takes composition roots as parameters rather than assuming a layout.

**Incidental.** The number of repositories, their names, and the choice to keep the governance
surface separate from workloads are conveniences of this build. A single-repository realization
satisfying the same obligations would be equally conformant.

## 4. The sealed snapshot as the boundary object

**Obligation.** There must exist one well-defined **baseline state**, and one sealed artifact that is
its **authoritative executable representation** — not a description of that state, not a build output
alongside others, but the object whose identity is the system's identity at that moment.

The two are distinct and the distinction is load-bearing:

$$B_n \;\xrightarrow{\;\mathcal{C}\;}\; S_n$$

$B_n$ is the complete *authored protocol state* — the artifacts a transformation produced, in the
form a human or a generator wrote them. $S_n$ is its *sealed, content-identified compiled
representation*. Only $S_n$ is executed; only $S_n$ is what a pin names; only $S_n$ has an identity
derived from content. A reader who conflates them will ask whether "the baseline" means the source
protocol state or the compiled artifact, and the answer is that both exist, with different roles: the
baseline is what a transformation produces and what the next transformation reads for reuse; the
snapshot is what execution and pinning address.

This sealed artifact is the hinge of the entire model, and its role is easiest to see when both halves of
the paper are drawn together.

                                                    Sₙ₊₁
```

*Figure 4 — The snapshot as the boundary between state and change. It is the sealed representation
of a baseline, which is what makes pinning and comparison expressible.*

Calling the snapshot "the sealed representation of a baseline" rather than "the compiled output"
changes what can be said. To pin a baseline is then to name a snapshot; to compare two baselines is
to compare two sealed objects rather than two intentions; and the recursion of §11 becomes a
sequence of named things rather than a narrative about releases.

**Obligation, stated operationally.** For the seal to mean anything:

- the snapshot must have an identity derived from its content, so that two claims about "the same
  baseline" can be checked rather than trusted;
- assembly must be reproducible from committed source together with declared, pinned build inputs,
  so the identity is a property of the material rather than of the machine that built it;
- nothing may be admitted at execution time that was not present at seal time, and this must be a
  structural property rather than a discipline.

**Realization.** Assembly produces a content-derived snapshot identifier and verifies the composition
round-trip on every build. Reproducibility is checked by deleting every build output and rebuilding
from committed source together with the declared, pinned build inputs, expecting an unchanged
identifier — a practice consistent with the goals of
the reproducible-builds literature \[Lamb & Zacchiroli, 2022\]. The execution boundary reads the
sealed snapshot once, at startup, and reports the identity it booted with, so that a stale process is
a one-line comparison rather than an inference.

**Incidental.** The particular hash construction, the on-disk layout of the snapshot, and the
decision to report the identity in a startup banner.

**A realization hazard worth recording.** A platform artifact may be compiled into more than one
place within a single composition — once per domain that imports the governance surface, for
instance. Nothing in the architecture forbids this, and nothing about it is visible until the copies
disagree. In the reference implementation they did: editing one governance artifact and recompiling a
single domain left five copies of it in two versions, and the composition assembled, verified
round-trip, and reported conformance while the published capability surface answered from a stale
copy. The obligation this yields is general: **every copy of an identity within a composition must be
identical, and the assembler must check it rather than the builder remember it.** §16 returns to why
this class of defect is invisible to architecture.

## 5. Closure: what a platform must be finite in

**Obligation.** Governance is tractable only over a finite surface. A realization must therefore
close something, and must say what.

Three closures are load-bearing:

- **The capability surface.** The set of side-effecting capabilities is fixed for a given profile. A
  domain may compose them; it may not introduce a new one.
- **The concern vocabulary.** The categories of execution concern are fixed. New behavior arises by
  composition within the vocabulary, never by adding a category at runtime.
- **The admissibility set.** The set of admissible execution paths is exactly what compilation
  constructed; execution adds none.

Closure is what converts governance from an aspiration into a finite question. Where the surface is
open, "what can this system do?" has no answer short of reading all of the code — which is precisely
the position the architecture exists to escape \[Ganti, 2026l\]. This is the same move that
capability-based security makes against ambient authority \[Dennis & Van Horn, 1966; Miller, 2006\],
generalized from authority to behavior.

**The cost, stated plainly.** Closure has a price, and a realization paper should name it: *the
capability that does not yet exist is invariably the one a new domain needs.* In the reference
implementation this occurred twice. A domain needed the current time, which no capability provided
and which cannot be a pure transform; and a domain needed to change part of a stored record without
replacing it, where the store offered whole-value replacement at a key and field-merge across a
filter, but nothing that merged fields at a key.

Both cases resolved the same way, and the pattern is the obligation: **when a domain needs a neutral
mechanism the substrate lacks, the substrate gains it — the domain does not improvise.** The
alternative was available in the second case and was rejected: the filtered merge could have been
used, and would have been correct only because that domain happened to guarantee that its filter
matched exactly one record. That correctness would then have travelled with the pattern to every
domain that copied it, without the guarantee. A business domain compensating for a missing substrate
operation with its own invariant produces exactly this: a correction that carries an unstated promise.

**Realization.** Six side-effecting capabilities, closed by an invariant that enumerates them. Both
gaps above were closed by extending the neutral surface, not the domain — in the second case by
adding one operation to an existing capability, which left the enumerated set unchanged and therefore
required no governance amendment.

**Incidental.** Which six, and the specific operation vocabulary of each.

## 6. Reachability: a platform that cannot be reached is not functioning

**Obligation.** A platform whose acts cannot be invoked from outside it is a library. If governance
is to extend to *what may be asked of the system*, the boundary must be a governed contract rather
than a wrapper around one.

The requirements are:

- **A public act has a name of its own.** What a caller names must be distinct from what performs the
  act, so that the performer may be replaced without any caller changing.
- **What a caller may send is declared, not inferred.**
- **What a caller is told is a governed classification**, drawn from a closed set, carrying no
  transport semantics.
- **The adapter is non-authorial.** Protocol mechanics only; it decides nothing about meaning.

```
        caller
          │  names an act, sends declared fields
          ▼
    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  boundary: ingress contract                │
    │    · operation identity (public, stable)   │

    │    · mapping onto what the act needs       │

                        ▼
                     answer
```

*Figure 5 — The governed boundary. The public name and the act are separate declarations, which is
what allows one to change without the other.*

**Why the separation is load-bearing.** If a caller names the performer, then re-pointing the act
breaks every caller, and the system's public surface becomes a function of its internal structure.
Separating them means a public name can outlive several implementations of what it reaches. In the
reference implementation this was exercised deliberately: two public names were bound to a single
act, because the business regarded the two as distinct in kind while the machinery performed them
identically. Callers cannot tell, and need not.

**What a client is permitted to be.** A client collects, sends, and renders. It holds no rule. This
is stronger than it sounds and is routinely violated for good reasons: a form that validates before
sending is a second opinion the governance never approved, and the two opinions will eventually
disagree. The obligation is that **the platform judges and says which field was at fault; the client
displays that judgment.** A client that validates has become a second, ungoverned author of
admissibility.

**Realization.** Boundary contracts are compiled artifacts sealed into the snapshot and read once at
startup. A route may carry a fixed act, or admit a family of acts whose identity travels in the
request, with the namespace checked as an *admission constraint* rather than used as a dispatcher —
the adapter never branches on what an identity means. The reference client carries no validation
attributes at all, so that a missing required field is refused by the platform, which names it.

**Incidental.** The wire protocol, the route table format, and the choice to serve a browser client
at all.

## 7. Inspection: a platform must answer questions about itself

**Obligation.** A governed composition that cannot be interrogated is governed only in principle.
Realization requires that the questions governance asks — what exists, what depends on what, what
consumes this store — have answers obtainable *through* the governance model rather than around it.

The failure this prevents is specific and common: a consumer that needs a fact about the composition
reaches into the compiler's internals to get it, and thereafter the compiler cannot change without
breaking a consumer that was never supposed to know it existed.

**Realization.** Inspection is realized as a domain, not a utility: it declares operations with
identities, reaches the composition through the same boundary machinery as any other domain, and is
the only sanctioned path to a compiled fact. The transformation tooling consumes it and imports no
compiler module; that constraint is the acceptance test for the inspection work.

**Incidental.** The operation names, and the decision to expose inspection over the same transport as
business acts.

**A realization hazard.** An inspection surface can be present, well-formed, and wrong. In the
reference implementation the operation answering "what consumes this store" returned an empty answer
for fourteen of fifteen stores, because the join it performed recognized only one of the three ways a
binding may declare where it writes. Every call succeeded. The obligation: **an inspection answer that
is empty must be distinguishable from one that is unknown**, and a realization should test its
inspection surface against facts established independently, because a confident empty answer is worse
than an error.

## 8. Evidence: execution must produce proof

**Obligation.** A claim that execution conformed is worth what it can be checked against. Realization
requires that every execution produce a record sufficient for an independent party to verify the
claim, and that the record be a governed artifact rather than a log.

This is provenance in the sense the provenance literature intends \[Moreau & Missier, 2013\]: not a
diagnostic byproduct, but a structured account of what produced what, retained because someone will
need it.

**Obligation, in detail.** The record must identify the act, the path taken through it, and the
effects produced; must be produced by the same traversal that produced the effects, rather than
reconstructed; and must be addressable, so that an answer given to a caller can be tied to the record
of the execution that produced it.

**Realization.** Every execution writes a trace addressed by identity; the boundary exposes a
*reference* to that trace rather than its content, so that an answer stays small and the evidence
stays retrievable. Where the platform serves a client, the reference resolves to the trace, and the
record of what happened is one request away from the answer reporting it.

**Incidental.** The trace format, its storage layout, and the reference syntax.

## 9. What "functioning" means

**Obligation.** A realization paper must say what it means to have succeeded, in terms that can be
checked rather than asserted.

A Profiled Normative Platform is **functioning** when it satisfies five conditions:

```
    ┌────────────┐   the composition assembles under a named profile
    │  COMPOSES  │   into a single artifact

*Figure 6 — The five conditions. A platform failing any one is not functioning, whatever else is
true of it.*

The conditions are deliberately modest, and the third is narrower than it may first appear. EXECUTES
requires that the *declared conformance workloads* run and produce what their declarations require —
not that every capability the platform declares has been demonstrated. That weaker reading is the
only one the evidence supports, and it harmonizes with §18: a governed platform is correct where
exercised and unverified elsewhere. A platform can satisfy all five conditions and still contain
capabilities no one has ever invoked.

The conditions do not require that the platform be useful, complete, or correct in its business
logic. They require that it be *governed in fact* rather than in description.
A platform that composes and seals but cannot be reached is a well-formed artifact and not a
functioning platform; one that executes but produces no evidence has no way to substantiate the
claim its architecture makes.

# Part II — Governed Transformation

*The verb. How a platform becomes its own successor, and what must hold for that to be defined.*

## 10. The baseline is a party to its own transformation

**Obligation.** Governed evolution requires that the current baseline participate in producing the
next one. This is stronger than requiring that it be consulted.

Conventional change treats the existing system as context: something to be read, understood, and then
modified. Governed transformation treats it as a participant with three specific roles.

```
                          Bₙ
                    ╱           ╲
              evidence          reuse
                    ╲           ╱
                     ╲         ╱
                      Problem P
                          │
                          ▼
              GOVERNED TRANSFORMATION  𝒯
                          │
                          ▼
                        Bₙ₊₁
```

*Figure 7 — The baseline as a party. It supplies reusable structure and the evidence against which
every claim is checked, and it bounds what the transformation may admit.*

- **It supplies reuse.** What already exists and satisfies a need is not rebuilt; the transformation
  must find it and say so.
- **It bounds admissibility.** What the next baseline may contain is constrained by what this one
  declares — its closed capability surface, its vocabulary, its governance.
- **It is the reference for empirical verification.** Every belief the change asserts *about the
  existing system* is resolved against it, and resolved before the change is designed.

The third role requires a boundary that is easy to lose. The baseline settles what *is*; it does not
settle what *may be*:

$$\text{Baseline} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{empirical truth about the predecessor}$$
$$\text{Governance} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{normative admissibility of the successor}$$

A change may verify every belief against the baseline and still be inadmissible, because
admissibility is decided by the governing artifacts and the conformance profile, not by what happens
to exist. Conflating the two would make the existing system the authority on what the next one may
become, which is precisely the drift governed transformation exists to prevent.

Two consequences follow, and both are formal rather than procedural.

**$\mathcal{T}$ is defined only relative to a pinned baseline.** A transformation validated against a
baseline it was not pinned to is not a weaker transformation; it is undefined. The facts it verified
were verified against something else. A realization must therefore make the pin explicit, carry it
with the change, and refuse to proceed when the observed composition does not match.

**A pin belongs to the change that was judged against it, and must not be advanced afterwards.** This
is subtle and was got wrong once in the reference implementation before being corrected. When a
change completes, the composition moves — *because that change moved it*. Re-pinning the completed
change to the new composition destroys the record of what it was actually judged against, and worse,
asserts a re-reading of facts the change itself falsified: a belief recorded as "this function has no
external boundary," true when verified, is false immediately after the change that added one. The
correct discipline is that the successor change pins the composition its predecessor produced. An
*in-flight* change whose composition moves for unrelated reasons may legitimately re-pin, because
nothing it asserted has been falsified by its own action.

**The stronger claim.** The existing implementation is part of the specification substrate for its own
successor. This is the sense in which governed transformation differs from specification-driven
development as conventionally practiced \[Schmidt, 2006; France & Rumpe, 2007\]: the specification is
not authored against a blank page and reconciled with an implementation afterwards; it is derived
against an executable predecessor that supplies half of it.

## 11. The recursion, and what survives it

```

                                              each arrow is an inspectable
                                              governed transformation
```

*Figure 8 — The recursion. A system's history is a sequence of governed transformations, not a
sequence of informal releases.*

**Preserved across composition.** The closure properties of §5 — a transformation may compose the
capability surface but not extend it, so the surface at $B_{n+1}$ is the surface at $B_n$ unless a
governed substrate change intervened. Authority enumeration. The property that execution adds no
paths.

**Re-established at each step.** Admissibility, which is recomputed by compilation over the whole
composition rather than inherited; evidence, which attaches to executions and not to baselines; and
every belief a change asserts, which must be re-verified against the pin rather than carried forward
from a predecessor's verification.

The distinction matters because it says what an auditor may assume. Properties in the first class
hold at $B_n$ for all $n$ once established. Properties in the second must be shown at each step, and
a realization that carries them forward implicitly has weakened the guarantee without saying so.

## 12. The shape of a governed change

**Obligation.** The transformation must proceed in stages, each of which either reorganizes what is
already stated or decides something new, and never both. The reason is auditability: a stage that
reorganizes and decides in the same act leaves no way to tell which of its outputs were derived and
which were invented.

The stages of the reference lifecycle run from a business problem to an authoring mandate. Their
*rationale* is the subject of the transformation companion \[Ganti, 2026k\] and is not restated. What
this paper contributes is the condition under which each transition is *defined*.

## 13. Determinacy: what must hold for $\mathcal{T}$ to be defined

$\mathcal{T}$ is partial. It is defined at a transition only when that transition's condition holds.

*Figure 9 — Determinacy conditions. $\mathcal{T}$ is defined at a transition only if its condition
holds; failure at any stage is reported at that stage.*

Several of these deserve comment because they are easy to state and hard to realize.

**Reorganizes or decides, never both.** The first stage restates a human-authored problem into
governed registers. It must add no content. A question the problem does not answer becomes a recorded
clarification request, never a filled-in guess; a belief about the existing system must not be
promoted to a fact. Realizing this requires the machinery to *refuse* a document carrying an
unanswered question, because a question answered by the process that asked it is indistinguishable
from a fact.

**Every belief resolved against the pin.** The stage that verifies claims about the existing system
is the spine of the whole lifecycle, and its output is three-valued: verified, absent, or
insufficient evidence. The third value is what prevents a change from proceeding on an assumption
that merely went unchallenged.

**The design determines its artifacts.** This is the condition at the construction transition and the
one that admits a measure. A design may be complete in the sense that every register is populated and
still fail to determine the artifacts it schedules — the two are different claims, and only the second
matters. The measure used here is derived from the shape the generator emits, walked leaf by leaf,
rather than from a hand-maintained checklist.

**The measure, defined.** Let $D$ be a design together with its mandate, and let $A(D)$ be the set of
artifacts that mandate schedules or that design amends. For each $a \in A(D)$, let the generator emit
its machine block and let $L(a)$ be the set of *leaves* of that block — every terminal position
reached by walking it, addressed by path. Let

$$L(D) \;=\; \bigsqcup_{a \in A(D)} L(a)$$

A leaf is **determined** when it carries a value, or when the design declared it empty:

$$\textit{determined}(\ell) \;\iff\; \textit{value}(\ell) \neq \varnothing \;\lor\; \ell \in \textit{declaredEmpty}(D)$$

Construction completeness is the proportion of determined leaves:

$$CC(D) \;=\; \frac{\bigl|\{\, \ell \in L(D) \;:\; \textit{determined}(\ell) \,\}\bigr|}{\bigl|L(D)\bigr|}$$

$$\boxed{\;CC(D) = 1 \iff D \text{ is construction-complete}\;}$$

and the transformation **refuses below 1**.

Three properties of this definition carry the weight, and each corrects a way the measure can be
made to lie.

**$L(D)$ is derived, never declared.** The leaf set *is* the shape the generator emits, walked at
measurement time. A hand-maintained requirement list is a second description of the generator that
drifts from it the moment either changes — and in the reference implementation it did, reporting full
determinacy while the generator could in fact reproduce only a small fraction of the artifacts it was
asked for. Deriving $L(D)$ from the emission makes drift impossible by construction: the measure
cannot disagree with the generator because it is computed from it.

**Declared emptiness is distinguished from omission.** An empty policy and an unstated policy are
identical in the output and different in meaning, so the difference must be a *declaration*. A
builder that knows a field to be intrinsically empty — reserved by the protocol version, say —
records it in $\textit{declaredEmpty}(D)$; a design that simply failed to state a value does not
appear there. Without this distinction the measure either penalises correct designs or excuses
incomplete ones.

**An artifact with no builder contributes an undetermined element.** If construction has no builder
for an artifact's family, that artifact contributes one element to $L(D)$ and it is never determined.
Omitting such artifacts from the measure entirely — which is what silently skipping them amounts to —
lets a design score $CC(D)=1$ while naming an artifact that cannot be produced at all. An unbuildable
artifact is the strongest possible construction failure, and it must not read as no failure.

The refusal at $CC(D) < 1$ is the mechanism by which a generator is prevented from becoming a second,
ungoverned author: a generator permitted to fill a gap has authored a design decision that no
governance approved.

**Amendment must not narrow.** A change that re-renders an existing artifact renders it *whole*. A
design stating only the delta therefore deletes everything it did not restate — and does so at full
determinacy, because determinacy never looks at what already exists. The realization must compare the
render against the composition and report facts that exist now and the design does not state. In the
reference implementation this check caught a design that would have silently dropped fifty-one facts
from a build manifest.

## 14. Amendment is not authorship

**The finding.** A governed lifecycle can be structurally incomplete while every stage appears fully
specified.

If the machinery assumes

$$\textit{Change} \;\Rightarrow\; \textit{NewArtifact}$$

then it cannot express

$$\textit{Change} \;\Rightarrow\; \textit{ExistingArtifactModified}$$

and the incompleteness is invisible until a change of the second kind is attempted. In the reference
implementation, three consecutive stages each demanded at least one row in the register naming what
the change creates. A defect correction creates nothing. The change was inexpressible — not
difficult, not inelegant: **inexpressible** — and the only alternatives were to manufacture an
artifact to satisfy the rule, or to version-bump the corrected artifact and cascade the change
through everything that named it.

What made this diagnosable was that the *generator* already knew better: it rendered what a mandate
schedules **and what a design amends**, with an explicit note that an amended artifact is never a
build step. The construction layer had encountered the case and handled it; the governance layer
forbade it.

**The obligation.** A governed lifecycle must admit the change that creates nothing. Concretely: the
registers naming what a change *creates* must be permitted to be empty, while the biconditionals that
bind them to later stages remain — nothing may be introduced that was never named, and nothing
scheduled that was never designed. What is removed is only the demand that the sets be non-empty.

**Why this belongs in a realization paper.** No architectural review would have found it. Every stage
was specified, every rule was justified, and the composition of the rules excluded a legitimate class
of change. That composition is only visible when something in the excluded class is attempted.

## 15. Partial function, total process

$$\mathcal{T}: (B_n, P) \rightharpoonup B_{n+1} \qquad \text{partial}$$

$$\textsf{TransformationProcess}(B_n, P) \longrightarrow \textsf{Outcome} \qquad \text{total}$$

Not every problem yields a next baseline, and a model claiming otherwise would be false. But the
*process* is total with respect to outcome reporting:

```
    TransformationProcess(Bₙ, P) yields exactly one of:

    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │   Bₙ₊₁                            success                 │
    │   inadmissible at stage k         with stated findings    │
    │   unresolved obligation at k      named                   │
    │   failure at stage k              located                 │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    never:    ???
```

*Figure 10 — Total process. A transformation that cannot proceed says where and why.*

This is the distinction that makes governed evolution **auditable rather than merely careful**. A
careful process reduces the chance of an undiagnosed failure. A total process eliminates the
category: every outcome is a stated one, at a named stage, in a form another party can check.

The realization requirement is that failure be *located and reported*, not merely detected. A stage
that refuses must say which rule refused, over which row, and why — and must report every finding in
one pass rather than the first, because a design is owed all of what it fails rather than an
iterative reveal.

## 16. The three functions, composed

$$\boxed{\;(B_n, P) \;\xrightarrow{\;\mathcal{T}\;}\; B_{n+1} \;\xrightarrow{\;\mathcal{C}\;}\; S_{n+1} \;\xrightarrow{\;\Phi\;}\; (R, T)\;}$$

```
        Bₙ  +  Problem P
              │
              │   𝒯    TRANSFORMATION  — changes the governed system
              ▼
           Bₙ₊₁                       a baseline: authored protocol artifacts
              │
              │   𝒞    COMPILATION    — seals admissible execution state
              ▼
           Sₙ₊₁                       a snapshot: immutable, content-identified
              │
              │   Φ    EXECUTION      — realizes admissible behavior
              ▼
          (R, T)                      result and evidence
```

*Figure 11 — The three functions. Each governed, each inspectable, composing into the life of a
governed system.*

| | function | changes | partiality |
|---|---|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | $(B_n,P) \rightharpoonup B_{n+1}$ | the system | partial — not every problem yields a baseline |
| $\mathcal{C}$ | $B_{n+1} \rightharpoonup S_{n+1}$ | nothing; seals | partial — inadmissible artifacts have no compiled form |
| $\Phi$ | $(S_{n+1}, I, \sigma) \rightarrow (R,T)$ | governed state | total over admitted inputs |

**What the composition guarantees that no single function does.** Each function alone yields a
familiar and insufficient thing. $\mathcal{C}$ and $\Phi$ together give a governed program: behavior
constructed rather than authored, executed by an interpreter that decides nothing. That is the
subject of \[Ganti, 2026l\] and of the earlier PGS work. $\mathcal{T}$ alone gives a methodology for
producing specifications. Composed, they give something neither provides: **a system whose every
state is sealed and executable, and whose every transition between states is itself a governed,
inspectable object.** The history of the system becomes a chain of such objects rather than a
narrative about releases.

**On the prior formal model.** Earlier work formalized this substrate as a tuple of functional
responsibilities covering authoring, governance, compilation, execution, and structure \[Ganti,
2026b\]. That decomposition is correct and is properly contained here: it describes $\mathcal{C}$ and
$\Phi$ and the material they operate on. What it does not describe is $\mathcal{T}$, because at the
time it was written the transformation of one baseline into the next had not been realized and could
not be formalized from first principles. Nothing in it is retracted. It was complete as an account of
construction and execution, and incomplete as an account of a system's life.

---

# Part III — What Realization Surfaced

## 17. Defects surfaced only through realization

A realization paper reporting only successes is a brochure. This section reports what constructing
the platform exposed, because the classes are instructive even where the specifics are not.

**Five principal defects are discussed below; three further realization findings are recorded in
Appendix C**, which is the complete register. Each of the five lived on a path that had never been
executed.

**Determinacy unsatisfiable for an entire artifact family.** The construction measure required, for
each artifact, that every leaf be determined or declared empty. The builder for one artifact family
emitted a reserved field that was always empty and had no way to declare it so. Every artifact of
that family therefore measured one short of total, against a threshold that refuses below total. The
consequence was not a warning: **no artifact of that family could ever have been constructed by
anyone**, and the fact was invisible because no one had constructed one.

**Structured payloads silently malformed.** The same builder mapped fields by name into a flat
structure. A field addressed by a dotted path — naming a value inside an object — became a key with a
dot in its name, and the object the act expected was simply absent. Correct for a payload one level
deep; wrong for any other; and the only prior use had been one level deep.

**Constants delivered as prose.** A design states the values an act needs that a caller must not
supply. The builder copied those cells verbatim, so a value stated as *"constant ACCEPTED"* reached
the act as the string `"constant ACCEPTED"`. The design language had no convention distinguishing a
value from a description of a value, and nothing had ever needed one.

**Declared events that could not fire.** Domains declared events for the moments they recognized. The
generator wrote, on each terminal node, a field that no constitution declared, no compiler assertion
checked, and no runtime read — and never wrote the one field the platform actually consults. Every
domain the generator produced therefore declared events it could never fire, while every hand-authored
domain fired them correctly. The field that worked was the one nothing wrote. Nine declared events
across two domains were unreachable, and every document check passed.

**Rules declared and never enforced.** Two rules in a single subdomain were stated in the governing
documents and realized in no artifact: that a rejection must state its grounds, and that a person
keeps the details they were admitted with. Every phase rule passed, because a rule that no step
consults is a true statement *about* an artifact rather than a property *of* one. The second was
found only by executing the function and reading what it left behind: recording a decision replaced
the person's whole record, silently destroying the name and preferences they had registered with, and
succeeding every time.

## 18. Coverage, not maturity

$$\textit{DefectDiscoveryRate} \;\approx\; f(\textit{UnexercisedSurface})$$

The five principal defects share a property more informative than any of them individually: **each
lived on a path that had never been executed.** The three further findings in Appendix C share it
too. None was a corner case, a race, or a subtle interaction. Each
was an entire capability non-functional the first time anyone used it.

That yields a general statement about governed systems, and it is the more useful contribution of
this part:

> A governed implementation is **correct where exercised and unverified elsewhere**. The rate at
> which realization defects are discovered is a function of unexercised surface, not of the
> implementation's maturity.

The distinction matters because the two have opposite remedies. If the discovery rate reflected
immaturity, the remedy would be time and polish. Because it reflects coverage, the remedy is to
exercise surface deliberately — and the surface to exercise is enumerable, because a governed system
declares its own registers, families, and stages.

**What would signal approaching completeness** is therefore not the absence of defects but a
particular event: *a change that exercises a genuinely new shape and finds nothing.* Until that
occurs, the correct expectation is that the next new shape will find something.

**The class of instrument that raises coverage.** Where a system holds a corpus of *inadmissible*
cases — documents that must be refused, each isolating one rule — it may hold no *maximal admissible*
case: a single synthetic instance populating every register and naming every artifact family, whose
only job is to traverse the whole generator once. Four of the five defects above would have been
caught by one such case, at build time, in a single run, rather than one per change over several
days. This is offered as an example of the class rather than as a prescription: the general principle
is that coverage instruments should be shaped by the enumerable surface the system declares about
itself.

## 19. Realization as a distinct epistemic activity

The five defects, and the coverage principle they yield, support the paper's methodological claim:

> **Architecture establishes invariants. Realization establishes whether an implementation
> instantiates them.** These are different activities, and treating them as one is a plausible
> explanation for why architectures are so often correct while the systems built from them are not.

Each defect in §17 occurred *beneath* a correct architectural statement. The architecture said
declared events are announced at the moments a domain recognizes; the generator wrote a field nothing
read. The architecture said a design determines its artifacts; the measure could not be satisfied for
one family. The architecture said a governed change proceeds through admissible stages; the stages
composed to exclude a legitimate class of change. In each case the invariant was right and
uninstantiated.

This is not an argument that architecture is unimportant. It is an argument that an architecture
*plus a claim of conformance* is two claims, and that the second requires its own evidence. Formal
verification establishes properties of an implementation against a specification \[Lamport, 2002;
Jackson, 2006\]; realization evidence, as used here, is weaker and cheaper: it establishes that the
paths a system declares have been traversed at least once, and reports what that traversal found. For
systems that declare their own structure, this is unusually tractable, because the surface to be
covered is enumerable rather than inferred.

There is a long-standing observation that a rational design process is something one fakes in the
writing rather than follows in the doing \[Parnas & Clements, 1986\]. Governed transformation makes a
narrower and more checkable claim: the *record* of the process is produced by the process, so what is
written down is what happened, including the refusals.

## 20. What the reference implementation demonstrates, and what it does not

**Demonstrated.** A composition of a governance surface, conformance workloads, and business domains
assembling under a profile into a content-identified snapshot, reproducible from committed source
against declared, pinned build inputs. A
platform reachable across a governed boundary, answering inspection queries about itself, and
producing an evidence trace addressable from the answer it returns. A sequence of governed
transformations of a single business subdomain, each pinned to its predecessor's composition,
including one that authored no artifact at all and changed two lines of one. A substrate extension
performed on the neutral surface rather than in the domain that needed it. Failure semantics
exercised throughout: refusals located at named stages, with findings reported in one pass.

**Not demonstrated.** Composition across many business subdomains at scale; more than one conformance
profile over the same material; concurrent transformation by multiple authors; adversarial use of any
kind. The reference implementation has not been operated by anyone other than its author, and the
claims in this paper are correspondingly bounded: they are claims about what a realization requires
and what one realization exhibited, not claims about production operation.

**A note on the deferred.** Three declared rules in the demonstrated subdomain remain unenforced
within it, and are recorded rather than concealed. Two are enforced at the boundary and not in the
act; one is unenforced entirely. They are carried deliberately to the next transformation, where the
first real consumer of that subdomain's state will make them testable against data rather than
against a testbed. A realization paper that reported the subdomain as complete would be describing a
different system.

## 21. Conclusion

The architecture of protocol-governed computing was established in two companion papers: execution as
declarative traversal of a compiled protocol, and evolution as the governed transformation of an
executable baseline into its successor. This paper asked what it takes to realize both, and what one
learns by doing so.

The answer has two halves that cannot be separated. A **Profiled Normative Platform** is a composition
under a profile, sealed into an identified snapshot, reachable across a governed boundary, able to
answer questions about itself, and producing evidence of what it did — five conditions, each
checkable, none satisfied by description alone. **Governed transformation** is the same platform
becoming its successor, with the current baseline participating rather than observing: supplying
reuse, bounding admissibility, and standing as the reference for empirical claims about what exists,
while governance retains authority over what may be admitted.
The transformation function is partial while the transformation process is total, which is what makes
governed evolution auditable rather than merely careful.

Composed, the three functions — transformation, compilation, execution — give an account of a
governed system's life in which every state is sealed and executable and every transition between
states is itself a governed object. That is a stronger claim than either companion makes alone, and
it is available only once both have been realized.

The third contribution is methodological and was not anticipated. Constructing the platform surfaced
defects that no architectural review would have found, all of the same class: correct invariants,
uninstantiated. That regularity yields a statement worth carrying beyond this system — a governed
implementation is correct where exercised and unverified elsewhere, and the rate at which its
realization defects surface is a function of unexercised surface rather than of maturity. It follows
that realization deserves treatment as an activity in its own right, with its own evidence, rather
than as the labor that follows design.

Architecture states what must be true. Realization is where one finds out.

## Appendix A — The reference implementation

**Purpose.** The implementation is cited as evidence for the obligations in Parts I and II and as the
source of the findings in Part III. It is not the subject of this paper, and no claim here depends on
any of its particular choices.

**Composition.** A governance surface declaring the closed capability set, the concern vocabulary, and
the constitutional invariants. Conformance workloads whose execution proves conformance to that
surface. Business domains realizing business functions. A protocol compiler producing domain
projections; an assembler composing them into a snapshot; a runtime executing the sealed snapshot; a
transport boundary; an inspection domain; and a transformation toolchain implementing the staged
lifecycle of §12–13.

**Reproducing a baseline.** Compile the governance surface, compile each domain that declares source,
assemble. Deleting every build output and rebuilding from committed source, against the declared
pinned build inputs, is expected to yield an unchanged snapshot identity; this is the reproducibility
check referenced in §4. Reproducibility across differing tool versions has not been demonstrated and
is not claimed.

**Exercising a platform.** Serve the composition across the transport boundary, invoke a declared act,
and follow the evidence reference in the answer to the trace of the execution that produced it. The
five conditions of §9 are checkable in that order.

**Scope of evidence.** Single author, single operator, one conformance profile, one business domain
transformed repeatedly. See §20 for what this does and does not support.

## Appendix B — Realization requirements, extracted

*The ageing test made mechanical: every obligation from the body, with no implementation.*

**Platform**

1. The platform boundary is a composition under a named conformance profile, not a storage boundary.
2. There exists one artifact that is the baseline, with an identity derived from its content.
3. Assembly is reproducible from committed source together with declared, pinned build inputs.
4. Nothing is admitted at execution time that was not present at seal time, structurally.
5. Every copy of an artifact identity within a composition is identical, and the composition checks
   this rather than relying on build discipline.
6. The capability surface, the concern vocabulary, and the admissibility set are closed for a profile.
7. When a domain requires a neutral mechanism the substrate lacks, the substrate is extended; the
   domain does not compensate with a local invariant.
8. A public act has an identity distinct from whatever performs it.
9. What a caller may send is declared; what a caller is told is a governed classification from a
   closed set.
10. The boundary adapter is non-authorial: protocol mechanics only.
11. A client holds no rule, performs no validation, and stores nothing the platform holds.
12. The composition is interrogable through governed operations, and no consumer reaches into a
    compiler's internals for a fact.
13. An empty inspection answer is distinguishable from an unknown one.
14. Every execution produces evidence sufficient to check that it conformed, produced by the same
    traversal that produced the effects, and addressable from the answer returned.
15. A platform is functioning when it composes, seals, executes, answers, and proves.

**Transformation**

16. The current baseline participates in its own transformation: supplying reuse, bounding
    admissibility, and serving as the reference for verification.
17. A transformation is defined only relative to a pinned baseline, and refuses to proceed when the
    observed composition does not match the pin.
18. A pin belongs to the change judged against it and is never advanced after that change completes.
19. Each stage either reorganizes what is stated or decides something new, never both.
20. A question the problem does not answer is recorded as an open question, never filled in.
21. Every belief about the existing system is resolved against the pin, three-valued: verified,
    absent, or insufficient evidence.
22. A design determines the artifacts it schedules; determinacy is derived from what the generator
    emits rather than from a maintained checklist.
23. A leaf declared empty is distinguishable from a leaf left undetermined.
24. A generator may not fill a gap the design left; refusal below totality is the mechanism.
25. An amendment renders the artifact whole, and the realization reports facts that exist and the
    design does not restate.
26. The lifecycle admits a change that creates nothing, while retaining the constraints binding what
    is created to what was named and scheduled.
27. The transformation function is partial; the transformation process is total with respect to
    outcome reporting, locating every failure at a named stage and reporting all findings in one
    pass.
28. Properties preserved across the recursion are distinguished from those re-established at each
    step, and the latter are re-established rather than inherited.

## Appendix C — Findings register

| # | class | what was wrong | rule now in place |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | construction determinacy | a reserved always-empty field could not be declared empty, so no artifact of that family could reach total determinacy | the builder declares the emptiness it knows to be intrinsic |
| 2 | structured payload | a dotted field name became a flat key; the expected object was absent | dotted paths are expanded into the structure the act reads |
| 3 | value versus description | design cells were copied verbatim, delivering prose where a value was meant | a cell is read as a value unless it is a substitution token |
| 4 | dead field / silent absence | a field nothing read was written on every terminal node; the field the platform reads was never written | the generator writes the read field; the dead one is removed from the model and from every artifact carrying it |
| 5 | lifecycle expressiveness | three consecutive stages demanded at least one created artifact, excluding amendment | those registers may be empty; the binding constraints between stages are retained |
| 6 | declared, unenforced | rules stated in governing documents and realized in no artifact | found by execution validation; recorded, and closed by amendment where a consumer exists |
| 7 | composition integrity | copies of one artifact identity disagreed while the build passed every gate | the assembler compares copies and refuses a composition whose copies disagree |
| 8 | inspection blindness | an inspection operation answered for one store in fifteen, confidently and emptily | the join resolves every declared form, and precision is applied only where a binding is ambiguous |

## Appendix D — Vocabulary

Only terms this paper introduces or sharpens. The companions' vocabularies are referenced, not
restated.

**Profiled Normative Platform (PNP)** — a composition of a governance surface, conformance workloads,
and optional business domains under a conformance profile. The unit of governance and of release. Not
a repository.

**Conformance profile** — the selection that determines which governance surface and which workloads
compose a platform. Two profiles over the same material are two platforms.

**Baseline ($B_n$)** — the complete authored protocol state of a platform at a point in its history.
Sealed by compilation into a snapshot.

**Snapshot ($S_n$)** — the sealed, content-identified representation of a baseline; the only artifact
execution reads, and the object a pin names.

**Pin** — the identification of the baseline against which a transformation's claims are verified.
Belongs to the change judged against it.

**Determinacy condition** — the property that must hold at a transition for the transformation
function to be defined there.

**Construction completeness** — the determinacy condition at the design-to-artifact transition:
whether a design uniquely determines the artifacts it schedules, measured over the shape the
generator emits.

**Declared emptiness** — a design's explicit statement that a leaf has no value, distinguished from
the absence of a statement.

**Total process** — the property that a transformation attempt yields exactly one of a fixed set of
stated outcomes, never an undefined one.

**Functioning platform** — a platform satisfying the five conditions of §9: composes, seals, executes,
answers, proves.
